# Module 4 Challenge - Coding-Quiz

## Description

This website was built so a user can take a timed quiz, receive a score, store their score with their initials, and view and clear the score list. The user will click the start button for the quiz and be directed to a question with four possible answers choices. The user chooses an answer by simply clicking on the answer choice they deem to be correct. Correct and incorrect answers both automatically populate the next question with an indicator showing whether or not the answer was correct. Incorrect answers will remove time from the current amount of time left on the quiz timer. When the last question has been answered or the timer reaches zero the user is automatically directed to a new page displaying their score with a text box for them to enter their initials and save their score to a scorelist using the 'submit' button. Once the 'submit' button has been clicked the user is directed to the high scores page where they can clear the high scores list or return to the home page.

## Special Thanks

Thanks goes out to all the instructors and teacher assistants for their clear instruction and prompt and thorough answers to all my questions. Also, to all the students who joined in the study groups for their active participation and alternative perspectives. I was able to gain multiple insights I otherwise may not have gained towards the project without them. There is always strength in numbers.
